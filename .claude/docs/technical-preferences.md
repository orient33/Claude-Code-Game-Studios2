# Technical Preferences

<!-- Populated by /setup-engine. Updated as the user makes decisions throughout development. -->
<!-- All agents reference this file for project-specific standards and conventions. -->

## Engine & Language

- **Engine**: Godot 4.6
- **Language**: GDScript
- **Rendering**: Vulkan Mobile (Forward+)
- **Physics**: Jolt (Godot 4.6 default)

## Input & Platform

<!-- Written by /setup-engine. Read by /ux-design, /ux-review, /test-setup, /team-ui, and /dev-story -->
<!-- to scope interaction specs, test helpers, and implementation to the correct input methods. -->

- **Target Platforms**: Mobile (iOS / Android)
- **Input Methods**: Touch
- **Primary Input**: Touch
- **Gamepad Support**: None
- **Touch Support**: Full
- **Platform Notes**: All interactions must be single-finger drag or tap. No hover states. UI touch targets minimum 44x44 dp. Consider one-handed portrait/landscape play.

## Naming Conventions

- **Classes**: PascalCase (e.g., `PlayerController`)
- **Variables/Functions**: snake_case (e.g., `move_speed`, `take_damage()`)
- **Signals**: snake_case past tense (e.g., `health_changed`, `evolution_triggered`)
- **Files**: snake_case matching class (e.g., `player_controller.gd`)
- **Scenes/Prefabs**: PascalCase matching root node (e.g., `PlayerController.tscn`)
- **Constants**: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE (e.g., `MAX_HEALTH`)

## Performance Budgets

- **Target Framerate**: 60 fps
- **Frame Budget**: 16.6 ms
- **Draw Calls**: < 100 (mobile 2D target)
- **Memory Ceiling**: 512 MB (mobile constraint)

## Testing

- **Framework**: GdUnit4
- **Minimum Coverage**: Core gameplay systems (evolution, collision, gravity)
- **Required Tests**: Balance formulas, gameplay systems

## Forbidden Patterns

<!-- Add patterns that should never appear in this project's codebase -->
- [None configured yet — add as architectural decisions are made]

## Allowed Libraries / Addons

<!-- Add approved third-party dependencies here -->
- [None configured yet — add as dependencies are approved]

## Architecture Decisions Log

<!-- Quick reference linking to full ADRs in docs/architecture/ -->
- [No ADRs yet — use /architecture-decision to create one]

## Engine Specialists

- **Primary**: godot-specialist
- **Language/Code Specialist**: godot-gdscript-specialist (all .gd files)
- **Shader Specialist**: godot-shader-specialist (.gdshader files, VisualShader resources)
- **UI Specialist**: godot-specialist (no dedicated UI specialist — primary covers all UI)
- **Additional Specialists**: godot-gdextension-specialist (GDExtension / native C++ bindings only)
- **Routing Notes**: Invoke primary for architecture decisions, ADR validation, and cross-cutting code review. Invoke GDScript specialist for code quality, signal architecture, static typing enforcement, and GDScript idioms. Invoke shader specialist for material design and shader code. Invoke GDExtension specialist only when native extensions are involved.
